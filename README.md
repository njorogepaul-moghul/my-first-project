**Titanic Survival Analysis** 
_Project Overview_
The Titanic Survival Analysis project explores passenger data from the Titanic shipwreck to understand the factors that influenced survival.
Using data analysis and visualization techniques, this project aims to extract insights, identify patterns, and build predictive models to forecast passenger survival.

Usage

**Dataset**
The dataset is sourced from Kaggle Titanic Competition
and contains information about 891 passengers, including:
Passenger details (Name, Age, Sex)
Ticket and Cabin info
Travel class (Pclass)
Fare paid
Survival outcome (0 = No, 1 = Yes)

**Objectives**
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand data distribution and missing values.
Visualize survival rates across gender, class, age, and family connections.
Identify key factors influencing survival.
Build a predictive model to classify survival outcomes.

**Tools & Technologies**
Python
Pandas – data manipulation
NumPy – numerical operations
Matplotlib & Seaborn – data visualization
Scikit-learn – machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest)
Jupyter Notebook – interactive development environment

**Methodology**
Data Cleaning – handling missing values, encoding categorical variables.
Exploratory Data Analysis – visualizing survival trends, correlations, and distributions.
Feature Engineering – creating new features to improve predictive performance.
Model Building – training and evaluating multiple machine learning models.
Evaluation – measuring accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

**Key Findings**
Gender had the strongest influence: females had higher survival rates than males.
Passenger class affected survival: first-class passengers were more likely to survive.
Age also played a role: children had slightly higher survival chances.
Families traveling together had higher survival rates compared to solo travelers.

**USAGE:**
To explore data analysis, visualizations, and model training.
